> A web app designed to be used on the mobile,the purpose of that app is to decrease the illegal logging to the forest using sound detection.
>
> The app notify the user by email about the type of the needed sound if its a chainsaw, a shotgun or axe stumping sound.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to receive email notifications so I can stay informed about incidents of illegal logging and identify their types.
- As a user, I want the flexibility to add as many devices as needed to protect a larger area of trees effectively.
- As a user, I want a centralized location within the app to view and manage all my notifications, preventing them from getting lost in my email inbox.
- As a user,  I want to easily locate my devices on a map, ensuring they are not lost within the forest.
