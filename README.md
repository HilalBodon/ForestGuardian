> A web app designed to be used on the mobile,the purpose of that app is to decrease the illegal logging to the forest using sound detection.
>
> The app notify the user by email about the type of the needed sound if its a chainsaw, a shotgun or axe stumping sound.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to receive email notifications so I can stay informed about incidents of illegal logging and identify their types.
- As a user, I want the flexibility to add as many devices as needed to protect a larger area of trees effectively.
- As a user, I want a centralized location within the app to view and manage all my notifications, preventing them from getting lost in my email inbox.
- As a user,  I want to easily locate my devices on a map, ensuring they are not lost within the forest.

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title6.svg"/>

> To set up Coffee Express locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

Now, you should be able to run Coffee Express locally and explore its features.
